# Find safe places in Ruby

## Getting started

- cd into project directory
- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Run tests: `bundle exec rspec run.rb`

## Requirements

For this exercise we will be using Ruby. You basically just need rspec for running the tests locally. To install rspec just install the dependencies from the bundle using 'bundle install'.

To run the test, type in: `bundle exec rspec run.rb`

## Creating the solution

All things are located in the file run.rb. There you will find three defintions of functions: convert_coordinates(agents), find_safe_spaces(agents) and advice_for_alex(agents).

For each function exists a suite of rspec-tests with example input and exprected results from the function. You can find all the requirements of the challenge in this tests.

__By defaults the tests are disabled. Please enable the tests, by replacing the 'xdescribe' with 'describe'__.

## Running tests

To run the test:

```console
bundle exec rspec run.rb
```
