# Find safe places in Haskell

## Requirements

For this exercise we will use Haskell.
You need to have the Stack build tool installed and added to your path.

## Running the tests

The tests are grouped into 3 levels which each represent a method to be implemented
(see the comments before and after each group of tests) so you can implement and test each method
on its own.

To run the tests navigate into the project directory and execute `stack test`
